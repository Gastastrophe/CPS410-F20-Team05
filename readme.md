GTA V Self Driving Car w/ Motion
======================
Welcome to our GTA V self driving car experiment. This code trains a model to drive a car in GTA V by itself. The training set is a loop focusing on the inner-city southeast of the golf course. Note: the built-in GTA V driving AI *is not used* here. This model is trained based on the first person view from the driver's perspective, keyboard keypresses, and object avoidance from the YOLO model.

**Please do not attempt to run the self-driving car in GTA V online. It is a violation of Rockstar's EULA and your account may be banned!**

## Installation Instructions

1. Make sure you have the following installed:
	### Requirements
	------------ | -------------
	 - [Grand Theft Auto] (https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/271590/)
	 - [Anaconda] (http://www.anaconda.com/)
	 - [OpenIV] (http://openiv.com/)
	 - (Optional)[SimTools] (https://simtools.us/)

Note: simtools licenses cost money!

1. Navigate to your GTA V installation directory
1. Create a *mods* and *scripts* folder in the root GTA V installation directory
1. Copy the *update* folder to *mods* folder (so now it's in /mods/update)
1. Move all **.rpf** files from root folder to *mods* folder (Note: they are alphabetical. Be sure to copy *common.rpf* too)
1. Copy the following files from /_installME/GTA_Binaries_And_Scripts/binaries/ to root folder in GTA V
 - *dinput8.dll* (yes, overwrite)
 - *ScriptHookV.dll*
 - *ScriptHookVDotNet.asi*
 - *ScriptHookVDotNet2.dll*
 - *ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll*
1. Copy the *GTAScriptHookPlugin.dll* file from /_installME/GTA_Binaries_And_Scripts/scripts to the /scripts folder in GTA V
1. Open OpenIV
1. Open the ASI Manager window (under Tools -> ASI Manager)
1. Install ASI loader and OpenIV.asi (they sould turn green. Leave openCamera off, it will appear blue)
1. (Optional) install *GrandTheftAutoV_GamePlugin.zip* from /_installME/GTA_Binaries_And_Scripts/Simtools  by opening the simtools plugin manager and dragging the file into the installer.
1. Open Anaconda Navigator
1. Open the /Car/GTAV-Self-driving-car.ipynb
1. Run the first three lines (this may take a while as new packages are installed
1. Run the rest of the notebook
1. Enjoy!
